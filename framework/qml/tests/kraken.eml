Greetings,

You know Kraken. We have a genuine passion for crypto and we=E2=80=99re not=
 afraid to speak our mind or have a unique point of view -- even if it gets=
 us into trouble sometimes ;) We don=E2=80=99t blindly conform, even when i=
t=E2=80=99s popular or safe to do so. Like crypto, we=E2=80=99re not afraid=
 to be different.=20

Our branding should strongly reflect our values and personality.=20

We reveal today (to our more than 4,000,000 clients across nearly 200 count=
ries) new branding, including a website redesign.=20

Your Guide to Experiencing the New Look of Kraken

- We are Kraken. Don=E2=80=99t worry -- we=E2=80=99re not changing our name=
 Kraken is two syllables, fun to say, memorable, resonates with you emotio=
nally, conjures strong mental imagery, doesn=E2=80=99t restrict our future =
offerings (e.g., no =E2=80=9Cbit=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Ccoin=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=
=9Cblock=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Cchain=E2=80=9D, =E2=80=9Ccrypto=E2=80=9D, etc.)=
, contains an inherent sense of suspense and excitement, and plays on tradi=
ng themes like liquidity, depth, dark pools, etc.=20
- Kraken stands out in a sea of boring blue. A lot of companies, especially=
 tech and financial services, like to use the color blue. It=E2=80=99s a sa=
fe and popular color, as well as associated with trust, honesty and dependa=
bility. The problem is that too many companies and brands use this color. A=
s a result, blue then may as well be a boring beige. Bye-bye blue! Today we=
 welcome a bolder color that is more unique, better represents our personal=
ity and is guaranteed to grab your attention. This new main color evokes fe=
elings of richness and prestige, which is fitting considering Kraken has ha=
ndled over $140,000,000,000 in trades and is one of the oldest and most res=
pected crypto exchanges.=20
- A colorful industry deserves a colorful palette. Something we really like=
 about the crypto industry is its people. There=E2=80=99s something about t=
his space that attracts the outspoken, devoted, opinionated, and eccentric.=
 Our clients and team members are no different -- they are the most bright,=
 colorful and interesting minds. In addition to the bold crypto community, =
the industry itself is constantly evolving -- it is alive, vibrant, fresh, =
and impactful. We have chosen to drape Kraken in a deliciously fitting and =
bold color scheme.=20
- Crypto is a rabbit hole, and we are all Alice. Since learning about and e=
xperiencing crypto you may feel that you=E2=80=99ve been living a much more=
 exhilarating, suspenseful, dramatic, and purposeful life. I guess that=E2=
=80=99s what happens when you join a global revolution. Crypto is a grand a=
dventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It beckons the creative, =
rebellious and determined dreamers to rise and take action. This provocativ=
e spirit of crypto is brought to life in our new, adventure-themed illustra=
tions. As you move around our site, allow your eyes to linger and get lost =
in the beautiful and quirky illustrations.=20
- Are you ready for us, consumer market? Since 2013, we=E2=80=99ve been one=
 of the most popular places to buy, sell, or trade crypto. A popular segmen=
t for us has always been pro traders who wield our advanced trading feature=
s and charts to turn profits. Our plan has been and will be to always keep =
our traders top of mind while expanding our appeal to all other segments an=
d markets. In particular, we have known that our brand, personality and com=
pany mission have great potential in resonating with the consumer market. W=
e haven=E2=80=99t been shy about stating our purpose. Kraken is here to pav=
e the way for mass adoption of crypto and digital assets so that everyone c=
an have financial freedom and inclusion. You will see our tone of voice, lo=
ok and feel, products, UX, and interactions become more approachable, strea=
mlined, easy-to-consume, and more cool and fun. Crypto is really freakin=E2=
=80=99 cool after all. It=E2=80=99s about time that the world knows this, t=
oo :)
- Kraken will continue to evolve. Expect more improvements made and illustr=
ations added to the website, as well as advancements in trading interfaces =
and products, like [insert trade.kraken.com link]. Go to our blog to learn =
more about our rebranding efforts.

Now you=E2=80=99re prepared for your crypto journey. Go to Kraken and get p=
ulled into the intoxicating adventure that awaits you.=20

Thank you for choosing Kraken, the trusted and secure digital assets exchan=
ge.
