    The interface is queried by for types, subtypes, and the
    corresponding bodypart formatter, and the result inserted into
    the bodypart formatter factory.

    Subtype alone or both type and subtype may be "*", which is
    taken as a wildcard, so that e.g. type=text subtype=* matches
    any text subtype, but with lesser specificity than a concrete
    mimetype such as text/plain. type=* is only allowed when
    subtype=*, too.
